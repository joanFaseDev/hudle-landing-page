## My process

### Analysis

- There's two designs for this project, mobile and desktop, so we need to make the page responsive.

- Use a _main_ element as a global container then nest a _div_ inside with a _width_ in percentage, that way no padding is needed.

- Then create two _section_ element, each with a _h2_ heading. The first will contain the Huddle part with the illustration. The second will contain the community part with the link and social medias logos.

- The Register button is used as a link so we need an _a_ element with lots of styling (also there's an active part to style).

- We'll probably use CSS Grid on the desktop design, two columns will do for a nice layout.

- The image's background change between the mobile design and the desktop one. Maybe use _picture_ and _source_ elements to change the image through media queries.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Useful resources

- [Font Awesome - Bordered & Pulled Icons](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/style/pull) - This helped me set up a proper border for the social media's icons.
- [Font Awesome - Customizing Icons](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/style/custom) - This helped me using CSS custom properties targeting specifically the social media's icons
- [Easings.net](https://easings.net/) - A cool website i often used to copy/paste easing functions. Works wonder with the CSS _transition_ property (specifically for the property _transition-timing-function_)
